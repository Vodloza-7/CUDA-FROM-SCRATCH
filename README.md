# ⚡ CUDA-FROM-SCRATCH

#### HERE TO LEARN CUDA PROGRAMMING FROM **ZERO TO HERO**.

_EVERYDAY WE WRITE SOMETHING AND LEARN SOMETHING NEW WITHOUT USING AI TO CODE BUT GETTING HELP HERE AND THERE._

#### Hi there 👋

Welcome to our little corner where we study, learn and master CUDA Programming.

Meet the engineers partaking in this study:

- [Vodloza](https://github.com/Vodloza-7)
- [God-FearingCoder01](https://github.com/God-FearingCoder01)

## Rules of study are as follows:

1. No use of AI in code generation is to be employed.
2. Write something everyday.

## 💡 Pro Tip: CUDA on Google Colab

Since all our CUDA Experiments run on Google Colab - a platform I, [God-FearingCoder01](https://github.com/God-FearingCoder01), used to treat like mysterious allien technology - I went down a rabbit hole of internet searches and emerged with gold.

**Turns out, my lazy bones (okay, let's call it _efficiency drinven_ mindset) couldn't handle the "long way" of doing things.** Adding a new cell? Clicking around? Executing cells with mouse? Too slow. There had to be better ways.

Enter: [Google Colab Tips and Tricks](https://blog.gishub.org/google-colab-tips-and-tricks) - a lifesaver of a resource that taught me:

- Keyboard shortcuts for everything
- Faster cell execution
- Productivity hacks

## 🚀 Git Alias: Laziness == Efficiency

Still on the roll with productivity confessions... let's not forget [Git Alias](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-alias), a piece that's had me see more of `Git ci` instead of `Git commit` and `Git s` (inplace of `Git status`). "_A few keystrokes saved today, a few hundread by next week- it adds up._"

**Before you judge**😎  
The way I see it: If I can save finger energy on typing, I can use that brainpower for actual CUDA debugging (which, trust me, needs every watt).
